## HW1: Scatter Plots
In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based scatter plot to show the attached iris dataset by using D3. Users should be able to determine the x-axis (and y-axis) to show the values of one of the attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, when interacting with the tool. Besides, please render scatter points in different colors to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.

## HW2: Parallel Coordinate Plots
In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based parallel coordinate plot to show the iris dataset (the same as your homework #1) using D3. Users should be able to change the order of the axis because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away. Besides, please render poly-lines (flower samples) in different hues to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.

## HW3: Correlation Matrix
For this assignment, you are tasked with creating three correlation matrices corresponding to the three categories of abalone data: male, female, and infant, utilizing D3. The design should facilitate users in swiftly discerning correlations among attributes and in making visual contrasts across the three abalone types. Feel free to employ color codes, interactive elements, or any effective design principles to bring out the nuances in the data. Should you have any queries, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## HW4: Brushable Scatter Plot Matrix
For your upcoming assignment, you are to construct brushable scatter plot matrices for the Iris dataset utilizing D3. Given the dataset has four features for each class, your task involves generating a 4x4 scatter plot grid. Each plot should represent the relationship between two attributes, while plots along the diagonal should display histograms of the respective attribute. Furthermore, your system should enable users to select specific data points within a plot, and these selected points should be emphasized in the other plots for easier analysis. Incorporate color variations, interactive features, or any other design techniques that will enhance data representation.

## HW5: Stacked Bar Charts
Craft stacked bar charts to represent the World University Rankings using D3.

## HW6: ThemeRiver
Craft a themeriver to represent the house property sales using D3.

## HW7: Horizon Chart
Craft a horizon chart to represent air pollution data using D3.

## HW8: Sankey Diagram
Craft a Sankey Diagram to represent car evaluation data using D3.

## HW9: Spotify Tracks Dataset
In this homework, your goal is to implement an integrated system that can show the insight of Spotify Tracks Dataset.
